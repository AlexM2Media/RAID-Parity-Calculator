# RAID-Parity-Calculator
A Python-based RAID parity bit calculator with step-by-step visualization. Maybe will become a web tool.

I know this is not the first nor the last tool made for this. I've created this just to solve a Safety and HA exercise and as a mini project while learning python.

(Work In Progress)
